# ✅ Project Report – Slack Translator App (Ruby + WEBrick)

## ✅ Overview
You are developing a pure Ruby app using **WEBrick** that:
- Receives messages from Slack.
- Uses **Ollama (Llama 3)** for translation.
- Displays original and translated messages in a web interface.
- Allows sending translated replies back to Slack.

---

## ✅ Progress Summary

### 🔧 Backend
- WEBrick server created with routes: `/`, `/sse`, `/reply`, `/test-message`.
- Integration with `llama3.1:8b` model via Ollama is working.
- Test messages are automatically generated and translated successfully.
- Translations are logged correctly in the terminal.

### 💻 Frontend
- HTML page rendered via `views/index.erb`.
- Layout includes columns for English and Portuguese messages.
- SSE connection to `/sse` is successful (no console errors).
- Button to send test message works.
- Reply form is present and functional.

---

## ❌ Current Issues

### 1. **Messages are not appearing in the web interface**
- Server is sending SSE data correctly.
- Frontend is connected to `/sse`.
- No errors appear in the browser console.
- Still, received data is not updating the visual interface (DOM).

---

## 🧪 Tests Performed

- Delay added before sending test message to ensure browser connects first.
- Manual test message button verified as working.
- Backend confirms receiving and translating messages.
- Console logs confirm the `onmessage` event is active, but DOM updates do not occur.
- An error with `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` being parsed as JSON on `/reply` was identified and fixed.

---

## 📌 Additional Notes

- The app is very close to working fully: backend is stable, frontend is connected.
- The synchronization between server events and UI rendering is not behaving as expected, despite all components being active and error-free.

# ✅ Project Report – Slack Translator App (Ruby + WEBrick)

## ✅ Overview
You are developing a pure Ruby app using **WEBrick** that:
- Receives messages from Slack.
- Uses **Ollama (Llama 3)** for translation.
- Displays original and translated messages in a web interface.
- Allows sending translated replies back to Slack.

---

## ✅ Progress Summary

### 🔧 Backend
- WEBrick server created with routes: `/`, `/sse`, `/reply`, `/test-message`.
- Integration with the `llama3.1:8b` model via Ollama is working.
- Test messages are generated and translated successfully.
- **Session ID Consistency Updated:** The `/test-message` endpoint now uses the same session_id (read from the browser cookie) when simulating a new message. This ensures that messages are associated with the correct client session.
- Translations are logged correctly in the terminal.

### 💻 Frontend
- HTML page rendered via `views/index.erb` with two columns for English and Portuguese messages.
- SSE connection to `/sse` is active without any console errors.
- **SSE Callback Update:** The callback in `public/js/app.js` was modified to use `data.original` for messages with status `'received'` and `data.translated_text` for messages with status `'translated'`, resolving the issue where `undefined` was displayed.
- Duplicate SSE handling was removed/avoided by keeping all SSE logic centralized (either in the JS file or within the HTML) to prevent conflicts.
- Test message button and reply form are fully functional.

---

## ❌ Current Issues

- Previously, the frontend displayed `undefined` because the wrong field (`data.text`) was being referenced. This is now resolved by using `data.original` and `data.translated_text` as appropriate.
- Synchronization between the client session and backend messages is now working, ensuring the correct messages are displayed.

---

## 🧪 Tests Performed

- Added intentional delays to test message generation to ensure the browser's SSE connection is properly established.
- Manually triggered test messages and confirmed that the backend logs indicated the correct session_id was used.
- Verified that SSE events update the DOM with the correct message content, and the 'undefined' issue no longer occurs.

---

## 📌 Additional Notes

- The app is very close to full functionality: the backend is stable and the frontend now displays messages correctly after the recent updates.
- Future improvements can focus on enhanced error handling and UI refinements as necessary.
