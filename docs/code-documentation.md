# Code Documentation Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines guidelines to ensure that the SlackTranslator codebase is well documented, maintainable, and accessible to future developers.

## Inline Code Comments

- **Purpose:**  
  To document complex algorithms, non-obvious parts of the code, and key decisions.
- **Best Practices:**  
  - Use clear, concise language.
  - Ensure comments are updated alongside code changes, especially as the implementation transitions from frameworks like Sinatra to a custom pure Ruby server using WEBrick.

## API Documentation

- **Endpoint Annotations:**  
  - Document each API endpoint, including expected request parameters, response formats, and error codes.
- **Future Considerations:**  
  - Consider tools like YARD for generating documentation from inline comments.

## README File

- **Contents:**  
  - Project overview, setup, and installation instructions.
  - Testing and contribution guidelines.
- **Format:**  
  - Markdown is recommended for clarity.
  
## Architecture and Code Structure

- **File Organization:**  
  Group related functionalities logically, for example, by separating routes, services, and utilities.
- **Coding Standards:**  
  Follow Ruby best practices and maintain a consistent style throughout the codebase.
  
## Review and Maintenance

- **Code Reviews:**  
  Conduct periodic reviews to ensure code quality and updated documentation.
- **Automated Documentation:**  
  Explore automated solutions to generate API documentation reflecting the custom server implementation.
