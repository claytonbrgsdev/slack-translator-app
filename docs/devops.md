# DevOps Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the DevOps strategy for hosting, deploying, monitoring, and maintaining the SlackTranslator application. The focus is on simplicity and rapid deployment to support a proof-of-concept.

## Hosting and Deployment

- **Application Hosting:**  
  The application is built in pure Ruby using a custom HTTP server (WEBrick) and can be deployed on lightweight cloud platforms such as Heroku or Render. For local development, it can be run directly using Ruby.

- **Local Development:**  
  - Use a local instance of Ollama for translation.
  - Ensure that all necessary Slack API tokens and configuration parameters are managed through environment variables.

## CI/CD Pipeline

- **Continuous Integration:**  
  Integrate with services like GitHub Actions to run automated tests with each code push.
- **Continuous Deployment:**  
  Configure a deployment pipeline to push changes to the hosting environment after successful tests.

## Monitoring and Logging

- **Monitoring Tools:**  
  Use Ruby's built-in Logger for capturing runtime issues. Future implementations might integrate third-party monitoring services.
  
- **Log Management:**  
  Maintain file-based logs for debugging. Consider strategies like log rotation for long-term deployments.

## Scaling Strategy

- **Horizontal Scaling:**  
  In a production scenario, consider deploying multiple instances behind a load balancer.
- **Vertical Scaling:**  
  Upgrade server resources (CPU, memory) to ensure optimal performance.

## Security Best Practices

- **Environment Variables:**  
  Use environment variables to store sensitive configuration data such as API tokens.
- **SSL/TLS:**  
  Secure all externally exposed endpoints with SSL/TLS.
- **Containerization:**  
  Optionally, containerize the application using Docker for consistent deployments across environments.
