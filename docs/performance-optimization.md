# Performance Optimization Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines strategies to optimize performance across the SlackTranslator application's frontend, backend, and network communications.

## Frontend Optimization

- **Efficient Rendering:**  
  - Use ERB templates for server-side rendering via the custom pure Ruby server.
  - Offload complex processing to the server to minimize client-side load.

- **Real-Time Updates via SSE:**  
  - Keep SSE event payloads minimal by transmitting only essential data.

- **Optimized Styling:**  
  - Employ custom, lightweight CSS to ensure fast page load times.

## Backend Optimization

- **Asynchronous Processing:**  
  - Consider Ruby threading for simultaneous tasks such as capturing Slack messages and making translation API calls.
  
- **HTTP Request Efficiency:**  
  - Use a lightweight HTTP client (e.g., the `http` gem) for fast interactions with the Ollama translation service.
  
- **Caching Strategies (Future Consideration):**  
  - Cache frequently translated phrases to reduce redundant API calls.

## Network Optimization

- **Payload Minimization:**  
  - Transmit only essential data through SSE.
  
- **Efficient Error Recovery:**  
  - Implement retry mechanisms for intermittent network issues without overloading the server.

## Monitoring and Benchmarking

- **Logging:**  
  - Use Ruby's Logger to measure response times and monitor performance.
  
- **Benchmarking Tools:**  
  - Employ Ruby-based profiling tools to detect and address performance bottlenecks.
