# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## App Overview

**Name:**  
*Suggested Name:* SlackTranslator

**Description:**  
The application streamlines real-time multilingual communication on Slack by automatically translating messages. It enables professionals, especially non-fluent English speakers, to read incoming messages in their native language while replying seamlessly. Outgoing replies are translated back into English—with a confirmation step—before being posted to Slack. This proof-of-concept demonstrates the candidate's ability to build an integrated, real-time communication system using a custom pure Ruby server with WEBrick.

**Tagline:**  
"Bridging Language Barriers for Global Collaboration."

**Purpose:**  
- Reduce communication challenges in international teams.
- Enable users to read and reply in their native language with seamless English translations.
- Showcase technical capability in real-time message handling and translation.

## Target Audience

- **Primary Users:**  
  - Professionals working in global teams.
  - Developers and freelancers, particularly in regions where English is a second language.
- **User Goals:**  
  - Ease of communication through real-time message translation.
  - Confidence in responding to technical challenges.
- **Pain Points:**  
  - Difficulty in expressing complex ideas in a non-native language.
  - The burden of constant translation during high-pressure communication.

## Key Features

1. **Real-Time Slack Integration:**  
   - Captures messages using Slack's RTM API.
2. **Automated Translation:**  
   - Translates incoming English messages to Portuguese and vice versa using a local LLM (via Ollama).
3. **User Interface (Two-Column View):**  
   - Displays original English messages on the left and translated Portuguese messages on the right.
   - Includes a reply box for composing responses in Portuguese.
4. **Confirmation Process for Outgoing Messages:**  
   - Enables users to review translated replies before they are posted back to Slack.
5. **Real-Time Updates:**  
   - Utilizes Server-Sent Events (SSE) to push live updates to the interface.
6. **Logging and Monitoring:**  
   - Provides basic logging to track interactions and performance.

## Success Metrics

- **User Engagement:**  
  - Volume and frequency of message processing and user interactions.
- **Response Time:**  
  - Minimal delay from message capture to translation and posting.

  - Users are familiar with Slack and its RTM API.
  - The local translation service (Ollama) operates with minimal latency.
- **Risks:**  
  - Translation inaccuracies under high load.
  - Integration complexities with Slack's API.
  - Scalability challenges in a proof-of-concept environment.

## Scope and Timeline

- **Scope:**  
  - Focus on a proof-of-concept that demonstrates key functionalities.
- **Timeline:**  
  - Rapid development for a working prototype suitable for a job interview test scenario.
