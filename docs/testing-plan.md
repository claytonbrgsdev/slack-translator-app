# Testing Plan Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the SlackTranslator application, covering unit, integration, end-to-end (E2E), and manual testing methodologies.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Testing

- **Scope:**  
  - Test individual methods and classes, focusing on:
    - Translation API interactions.
    - Slack message parsing and processing.
    - Custom session and state management logic.
- **Tools:**  
  - Use RSpec or MiniTest for unit tests.

### 2. Integration Testing

- **Scope:**  
  - Validate the integration between the custom pure Ruby server endpoints (such as `/`, `/sse`, and `/reply`), the Slack RTM API, and the Ollama translation service.
- **Approach:**  
  - Simulate Slack messages and monitor the server's responses and SSE updates.
  - Verify that state changes (e.g., message translation statuses) are processed correctly.

### 3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

- **Scope:**  
  - Simulate a complete user journeyâ€”from receiving a Slack message, translating it, submitting a reply, to confirming and posting the reply back to Slack.
- **Tools:**  
  - Use testing frameworks like Capybara (or similar) and combine them with manual testing to validate real-time behavior.

### 4. Manual and Exploratory Testing

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Test scenarios such as network failures, invalid inputs, and high-frequency message streams.
- **Documentation:**  
  - Log test cases and issues encountered to inform future improvements.

## Test Environment Setup

- **Local Development:**  
  - Ensure that Slack RTM, the local Ollama API, and the custom pure Ruby server are configured correctly.
- **CI Integration:**  
  - Integrate tests into a CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run automatically on code changes.

## Success Criteria

- **Functionality:**  
  - Endpoints respond correctly and state management works as expected.
- **Resilience:**  
  - The system gracefully handles failures and maintains real-time communication.
- **User Experience:**  
  - The interface updates in real time with minimal delays.
