# Third-Party Libraries Documentation

## Overview
This document lists the third-party libraries and gems used in the SlackTranslator project. These libraries facilitate Slack integration, enable real-time communication, support translation services, and ensure overall project functionality.

## Libraries and Tools

### 1. Custom Pure Ruby Server (WEBrick)
- **Description:**  
  A lightweight HTTP server built using Ruby's built-in WEBrick library.
- **Purpose:**  
  - Handles HTTP routing, renders ERB templates, manages SSE connections, and processes requests for the web interface.
- **License:**  
  Part of Ruby's Standard Library.

### 2. http (gem)
- **Description:**  
  A Ruby HTTP client library.
- **Purpose:**  
  - Used for making API calls to the locally hosted Ollama translation service.
- **License:**  
  MIT License.

### 3. Slack RTM API Wrapper (e.g., slack-ruby-client)
- **Description:**  
  A Ruby gem that simplifies connecting to Slack's Real Time Messaging API.
- **Purpose:**  
  - Captures live Slack messages for processing.
- **License:**  
  MIT License (or similar, based on the gem chosen).

### 4. Ollama Integration via HTTP
- **Description:**  
  The translation component leverages a locally hosted instance of Ollama via an HTTP API.
- **Purpose:**  
  - Executes translation tasks using models such as Deepseek R1 Distilled.
- **License:**  
  Depends on the translation model's licensing requirements.

### 5. Logging Libraries (Standard Ruby Logger)
- **Description:**  
  Ruby's built-in Logger module.
- **Purpose:**  
  - Supports file-based logging for debugging and monitoring.
- **License:**  
  Part of Ruby's Standard Library.

### 6. Testing Libraries (RSpec / MiniTest)
- **Description:**  
  Frameworks for unit and integration testing in Ruby.
- **Purpose:**  
  - Facilitate robust automated testing across the application.
- **License:**  
  Varies by framework (commonly MIT License).

## Considerations and Future Additions

- **Customizability & Security:**  
  - All libraries were selected for their reliability, minimal overhead, and ease of integration.
  - Future requirements might introduce libraries for caching (e.g., Redis), advanced asynchronous processing (e.g., Sidekiq), or comprehensive monitoring.
